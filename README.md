## Installation

Clone the repository to you machine. Create a new mysql database (in the terminal, type 'mysql -uroot -p', enter password if needed. Then type 'create database ecommerce_db'. Then type 'quit' to exit the mysql shell). Then, in the terminal (in the root directory) type 'npm i' to install node packages. Then type 'npm run seed' to seed the database. Then you are ready! Type 'npm start' to start the server.

## Usage

This is just a sample backend. After starting the server with 'npm start' you can use a program such as Insomnia to make api requests and see how the database is effected. For example, send a GET request to /api/categories to view all the categories in the database.
